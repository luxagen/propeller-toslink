- use 4-colour mode on video generator with straightforward palette using pins 0-1 of the vgroup
- get two frames from main memory at once
- each 8 -> 16 BMC encoding step generates 16 bits per channel
- interleave the resulting bits into one word and deliver with a single waitvid
- blocks/preambles on two streams are synchronous, but subcodes can be different (even 1 AES and one S/PDIF!)
