- fused some of the Prop's upper pins high with experiments? maybe just trying to use the USB pins
- then found that 60 ohms wasn't enough - brownout protection would kill it after half a second because of excessive draw
- tried 90 ohms and that was stable with confirmed signalling on pin 15
- finally settled on a dual-fed LED with 16 kohm resistance to Vdd (to hold it active for faster switching) and 250 ohm resistance to signalling pin - this worked well (i.e. with air spacing between LED and fibre) with a 5m fibre
- used a simpler single-fed design for the vpin assessment board to save resistors, and proved that all pins of a vgroup are usable by the S/PDIF driver

EXTERNAL INTERFACE
- one phono for S/PDIF
- one TOSLINK socket
- one pushbutton for resetting the chip to account for a sample-rate change
- plug/socket pair with at least 8 conductors
- level shifter for MPXA,MPXB,INH,SCLK,LAEN?,SDATA
- opto-isolator for USB data lines?

plan

1. Attach power/data wires inside D-70 (with transmission resistors for signals) and attach to new board (connector?)
2. tap GND line and isolate +5V line to mini-USB lead
3. install USB B socket and temporarily connect data lines directly to mini-USB lead
4. power up D-70 and verify Propeller power
5. connect laptop to USB and verify USB interface
6. install 5V opto-isolator(s) and verify USB interface again
7. install level-shifter chip to connect D70 data lines to Propeller
8. work on signal-reading code
